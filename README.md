# AI-Face-Recognition-with-OpenCV-Deep-Learning
This project is an AI-powered face recognition system using deep learning and computer vision. It detects and recognizes faces in images or video streams, analyzing facial features for accurate identification. Built using OpenCV, dlib, and face-recognition libraries, this Jupyter Notebook provides an easy-to-use face recognition model.
